                  The purpose was to create a complete fullstack application
                  with plenty of functionality for both users and admin. The app
                  allows users to remain a guest or register/login while
                  browsing movies to buy. With 251 movie titles to choose from,
                  users can sort through the catalog either directly using the
                  search bar or sort by different categories including price,
                  popularity, and title.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The way we accessed so many titles was through another API
                  (omdbapi) where we pulled a list of the top 250 movies,
                  queried that database, selected the pertinent information for
                  this project, and placed it into our own database. Users can
                  also leave reviews for movies and check their order history
                  once a purchase is made.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  My specific contributions include handling the outside API,
                  displaying the movies, setting up the search bar and filter
                  methods, navigation between pages of displayed movies, and
                  creating the individual movie page to see full details. I was

                  users to create and search for routines and activities. As the
                  first time doing a fullstack application there were a lot of
                  challenges with connecting a frontend to a self-created
                  backend. However, the benefit and knowledge gained was beyond
                  worth. This project really established how effective it is to
                  know the flow of information throughout the entire system when
                  debugging and handling errors.

                  My specific contributions include generating the list of
                  activities as well as the ability to create new activities. I
                  was also in charge of attaching specific activities to
                  routines and allowing users to search for routines based on
                  user or featuring a specific activity.

                  One of my first solo JavaScript projects. Focusing heavily on
                  DOM Manipulation, this simple game of tic-tac-toe allows a
                  user to play against another human or against a CPU. Users can
                  input names or change them during the game and have it update
                  accordingly. The starting playing is randomized as well the
                  brief starting message to give users a sense of change
                  in-between games.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  When I update the project, I would like to add levels of
                  difficulty to the CPU as well as turn this application to one
                  of many in an arcade-like website.
