                This project was completed by myself and 3 other classmates. The purpose was to create a complete fullstack application with plenty of functionality for both users and admin. The app allows users to remain a guest or register/login while browsing movies to buy. With 251 movie titles to choose from, users can sort through the catalog either directly using the search bar or sort by different categories including price, popularity, and title. 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The way we accessed so many titles was through another API (omdbapi) where we pulled a list of the top 250 movies, queried that database, selected the pertinent information for this project, and placed it into our own database. Users can also leave reviews for movies and check their order history once a purchase is made. 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                My specific contributions include handling the outside API, displaying the movies, setting up the search bar and filter methods, navigation between pages of displayed movies, and creating the individual movie page to see full details. I was also responsible for allowing admin to edit or delete movie titles.

                This was a partner project building a PERN application featuring a fitness application. The main goal was enabling users to create and search for routines and activities. As the first time doing a fullstack application there were a lot of challenges with connecting a frontend to a self-created backend. However, the benefit and knowledge gained was beyond worth. This project really established how effective it is to know the flow of information throughout the entire system when debugging and handling errors.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                My specific contributions include generating the list of activities as well as the ability to create new activities. I was also in charge of attaching specific activities to routines and allowing users to search for routines based on user or featuring a specific activity.

                One of my first solo JavaScript projects. Focusing heavily on DOM Manipulation, this simple game of tic-tac-toe allows a user to play against another human or against a CPU. Users can input names or change them during the game and have it update accordingly. The starting playing is randomized as well the brief starting message to give users a sense of change in-between games.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                When I update the project, I would like to add levels of difficulty to the CPU as well as turn this application to one of many in an arcade-like website.
